EC2 hibernate:

States of EC2: Terminate and Stop
    Stop: The data on the disk (EBS) is kept for the next start 
    Terminate: any EBS setup will also be destroyed 

On start:
    *First start: OS Boots and EC2 DataScript is run
    *Next start: OS Boots

Another state: 

hibernate:
    *The in-memory RAM is preserved
    *The instance boot is much faster 
    *Under the hood, RAM state is written to a file in EBS 
    *The root EBS must be encrypted 


Use cases: 
    Saving the RAM state 
    Bootup fast 


*The RAM size must be <150GB 
*Not works for Bare metal
*hibernate must not be more than 60 days 

Hands-on:
    *From an OS perspective hibernate doesnot mean stop 
    *The EBS must be large enough to fit the RAM
