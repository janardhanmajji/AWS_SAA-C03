-> Some times we need control over the placement of the EC2  placement statergy
-> We donot get access to the underlying hardware but we let AWS know how we want our instances to be placed
-> There are 3 statergies:
    *Cluster - low-latency, Single-AZ 
    *Spread - Spread across hardware (max 7 instances per group per AZ) - critical applications
    *Partition - Similar to spread across many Partition


** Cluster: All EC2 instances are on same rack and same AZ 
            Drawback: If rack fails all EC2 instances failes at same time 
            Pros    : Great network with low latency 
            Use-cases: Big data job and applications which need low latency and high throughput 

** Spread: All EC2 instances are on different hardware
            Pros: Spread across multi-AZ 
                  Reduced risk of simultaneous failure
            Cons: Limited to 7 instances per AZ per placement group 
            Use cases: Critical applications which must be isolated from failure 

** Partition : 
        *Each Partition represents a rack in AWS 
        *To make sure the instances are safe from a rack failure
        *7 partitions per AZ 
        *Use cases: HDFS, HBase, Cassandra and Kafka
