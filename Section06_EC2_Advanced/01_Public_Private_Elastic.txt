-> Networking has two types og addresses IPV4 and IPV6
-> IPV4 is the most commomn used and IPV6 is used for IOT devices
-> IPV4 has 3.7 billiion different addresses [[0-255].[0-255].[0-255].[0-255]]


Public Ip vs Private Ip:

-> Public IP is accessible all over the internet whereas private IP is accessible within that organization or within that specific company
-> Public Ip can communicate with all public Ip's over the internet whereas if a private IP needs to communicate with internet it needs "internet Gateway"

Public Ip:

*Public IP means the machine can be identified all over the internet
*Their Geo location can be found
*No two devices can have the same public IP 

Private IP:

*Private IP means the machine can be identified in a specific private network only
*No two devices in a particular network can have the same IP but two devices in different private network can have same IP 
*Only a few IP's can be used for Private Ip 
*They can communicate with Public network (internet) with the help of "internet Gateway"

Elastic IP:

*Whenever we start and stop our EC2 instance the public IP changes
*If we want to keep the IP fixed we use Elastic Ip 
*An Elastic IP is a public IPV4 IP yoo own as long as we don't delete it 
*You can attach it to only one instance at a time 
*With an elastic IP we can mask the failure of an instance by remapping to another instance
*We can have only 5 Elastic Ip's in an account 

******Try avoiding Elastic Ip 
        *Instead use random IP and assign DNS 
        *Or we can use Load balancer without using Public IP 


Things to take from hands on:

-> We can SSH using Public address but not private 
-> If we stop and start the instance the IP changes 
-> If we use Elastic IP the address doesn't change 
-> We can SSH through elastic IP as (Public IP = Elastic IP)
