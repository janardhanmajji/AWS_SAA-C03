EBS Encryption:

When you encrypt an EBS:
    *The data-at-rest is encrypted
    *The data-in-flight between instance and volume is encrypted
    *Snapshots are encrypted
    *volume created from Snapshots are encrypted
-> Encryption and decryption are transparent 
-> Minimal impact on latency 

How to encrypt an unencrypted volume?

-> Create a Snapshot
-> encrypt the Snapshot
-> Create new Volume from Snapshot
-> Attach encrypted volume to the original instance
