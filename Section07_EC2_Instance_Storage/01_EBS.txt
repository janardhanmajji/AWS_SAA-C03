EBS

-> An EBS (Elastic Block store) is a network drive which can be attached to EC2 while they run 
-> They allow to persist data even after their termination
-> They are bound to a specific AZ 
-> AT a time, One EBS is mounted to a single instance 

EBS Volume:

*It is a network drive not a physical drive
    *As it is a network drive it uses network to communicate with EC2 due to which there may be latency
    *It can be attached to another EC2 quickly
*Bound to specific AZ 
    *To attach to another AZ we need to take a snapshot 


**Two EBS volumes can be attached to Single AZ but Single EBS cannot be mounted to multiple EC2 
** We can also create EBS volumes and leave them unattached 


Delete on termination attribute - By default yes for root volume and no for other volumes and we can change it 

**Controls EBS behaviour when EC2 is terminated
