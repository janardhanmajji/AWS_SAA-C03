EC2 Instance Store:

-> EBS (network drive) is good but it has "limited performance"
-> For high performance we need a hardware disk attached to an EC2 instance which is "EC2 instance Store"
-> It has physical connection to the instance
-> We will use for better IO performance and better throughput
-> If EC2 terminated then Instance storage is lost 
-> It is ephermal (not for long term storage)
-> Risk of data loss if hardware fails
