EBS Volume Types:

gp2/gp3: General purpose SSD which balances price and performance
io1/io2: Highest performance SSD for low-latency 
st1: low cost HDD for frequently accessed 
sc1: lowest cost HDD for less frequently accessed

General purpose SSD:
    *cost-effective and low latency 
    *gp3 is latest version of gp2
    *In gp3 throughput and IOPS are independent whereas in gp2 they are linked

Provisioned IOPS:
    *Critical business applications
    *Great for database workloads 
    *io2 has more durability and higher IOPS
    *supports EBS multi-attach

Hard Disk Drives:
    *throughput optimized - st1
    *Cold HDD - sc1
