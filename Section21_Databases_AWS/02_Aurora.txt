Aurora:

-> For Mysql and Postgresql
-> Storage: data is stored in 6 replicas across 3AZ available, self-healing and auto-scaling
-> Compute: Cluster of DB Instances across multi AZ, aoto-scaling of read replicas 
-> Cluster: custome end points for writer and reader DB instance 

Aurora serverless: for un-predicatble workloads, no capacity planning
Aurora Multi-Master: Used when we need continuous write (high write availabilty)
Aurora Global: upto 16 Read Replicas in each region (<1 second storage replication)
Aurora Machine Learning: perform SageMaker and Comprehend 
Aurora Database Cloning: new cluster from existing one...

Use cases: Same as RDS with more feautures and flexibilty and less maintainane
