Dedicated instance means having our own instance on our own hardware
Dedicated hosts we get access to the physical server itself

Analogy of a hotel:

-> Ondemand: come to the resort, whenever you like and pay the price for the time we stayed
-> Reserved instances: We already pre-booked for a long time so we get discount
-> Savings plan: We say that we are going to spend (like 300$ per month) for a certain time and stay in any room type
-> Spot instances: bid the empty rooms and we may kikked off  any time.
-> Dedicated hosts: Book the entire building
-> Dedicated instances: book a room for a period for full price and pay even we donot stay in it.
