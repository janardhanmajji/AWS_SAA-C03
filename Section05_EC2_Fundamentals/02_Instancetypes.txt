Naming convention of an instance:

Ex: m5.2xlarge

m: instance class
5: generation of the instance
.2xlarge : size within the instance class

1) General purpose instance:
-> Good balance between compute memory and networking
-> t2.micro is free tier general purpose instance

2) Compute Optimized:
-> Great for compute-intensive tasks that requires high-level processor
Use cases
    *High performance web servers
    *High performance computing
    *Dedicated gaming servers
-> Most of the compute optimized are of instance class "c"

3) Momory optimized
-> Large datasets in memory (RAM)
Use cases:
    *Real time processing of big unstructured data
    *In memory databases optimized for BI etc..
-> Most of them are instance class "c"


4) Storage optimized
-> Access to large datasets in local storage
Use cases:
    *OLTP
    *Relational and NOSQL
    *Cache for in-memory

-> Start with i,d
