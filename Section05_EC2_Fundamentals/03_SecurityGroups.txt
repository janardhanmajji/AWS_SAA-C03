SG:

-> Security Groups are the fundamental of network security in AWS
-> Control how the traffic is allowed into or out of the EC2 instance
-> SG have only allow rules
-> SG can refer by IP or by other Security Groups

Deep dive:

-> SG are like "firewall" for EC2 instance
-> They regulate
    *Access to ports
    *Authorized IP ranges
    *Control inbound network (from outside to the instance)
    *control outbound network (from instance to outside)

Good to know:

-> An instance can have multiple SG
-> A SG can be attached to multiple instances
-> They are locked to region/VPC combination
-> It lives outside the EC2 instance

-> It is good to maintain seperate SG for SSH access.
-> If the application is not accessible - "time out" then it is SG issue
-> If application gives "connection refused" error, then it is application error 

Default settings:
-> All inbound traffic is blocked
-> All outbound traffic is Authorized

Referencing SG from other SG:

-> Lets assume we have 4 instances A,B,C,D

-> A has security groups x and y as inbound
-> B has security group x and trying to communicate with A. It communicates as it has the same SG as A and the inbound is not stopped
-> C has security group y and it behaves same as B
-> D has security group z and it cannot communicate with A.
