EC2 Spot instances:

-> We can get a discount upto 90% compared to on-demand
-> Define max spt price and get the instance when current spot price < max
    *If the current spot price > max then we need to stop/terminate the instance in 2 minutes
    *Hourly spot price varies on offer and capacity

-> Spot block (AWS stopped this offering)

* Block spot instancce for (1-6 hours)
* In rare cases the instances can be re-claimed

-> Used for batch jobs, data analysis and workloads that are resilient to failures
-> Not great for critical jobs or databases

How to terminate a spot instance?

-> First we need to create a spot request which contains - Maximum price, required no of instances, request type - one time / persistent and valid from and till...

-> One time request:  As soon as the spot request is fulfilled instance is going to be launched and spot request would go away.
-> persistent request: If instances got stopped/terminated because of rge current spot price then spot request will restart the instance for us.
-> Cancelling a spot request doesnt terminate our instance
-> To terminate instance -> "first cancel spot request and then terminate spot instance"

Spot fleets:

Spot Fleets =  set of spot instances + (optional) On-demand instances
