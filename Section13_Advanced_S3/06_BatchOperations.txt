Batch Operations:

-> Perform Bulk operations on S3 objects with a single request.
Ex:

    *Modify object meta data and properties
    *Encrypt unencrypted objects
    *Restore objects from Glacier
    *Invoke lambda function to perform custom operation

Use cases:
    *Manage retries
    *Track progress
    *Send completion notifications

* we can use S3 inventory to get objects list and S3 Select to filter objects
