Event Notifications:

* Events in S3 are like ObjectCreated, ObjectReplicated, ObjectRestored etc...
* We can filter these Events
* Use cases: Automating events 
    Ex: generate thumbnails of images uploaded to S3
* We can generate as many "Event Notifications" we want.

* S3 events delivers events in seconds but sometimes it may take a minute or longer

IAM Permissions:
 
* To make event Notifications to work we need IAM Permissions.
* For ex: S3 send data to SNS   -> SNS resource access policy must be attached to SNS
* For ex: S3 send data to SQS   -> SQS resource access policy must be attached to SQS

Generally S3 event notofication targets are SNS, SQS and LAMBDa
But with the help of Amazon Event Bridge we can set 18 Services as destinations...
