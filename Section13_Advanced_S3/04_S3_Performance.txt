S3 Baseline performance

-> Amazon S3 automatically scales to high request rates, latency 100-200 ms
-> There are no limits to the no of prefixes in a bucket:

object path -> Prefix 

bucket/folder1/sub1/file -> folder1/sub1
bucket/folder2/sub2/file -> folder2/sub2

-> We can achieve 3500 put/post/delete or 5500 get request per second per prefix in a bucket.


S3 performance:

* Multi-part uploads: 
    *recommeded for files > 100MB and must for files > 5GB
    *can help in parallilze uploads (speeds up transfers)

* S3 transfer-accelaration:
    *Increase target speed by transfering file to AWS Edge location which forwards the data to S3 bucket in target region
    *Comitable with Multi-part upload. 

* S3 Byte-Range fetches:
    *Used to speed up dowloads
    *Paralleleize gets by requesting "byte range fetches"
    *better resilience in case of failures
    ***Can be used to retrieve partial data
