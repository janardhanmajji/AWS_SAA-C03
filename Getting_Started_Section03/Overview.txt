AWS Region

AWS Regions are all over the world
Names can be US-east-1, eu-west-2 etc
A region is a cluster of data centers
Most AWS services are region-scoped

How to choose an AWS Region?

1) Compliance: With government rules and regulations some data must be local to over country.
2) Proximity: Reduced latency (launch where most of our customers are staying)
3) Available services within a region: Check which services are available in which region. Accordingly choose a specific region.
4) Pricing: Varies from region to region. 

AWS Availability zones:

-> Each region have many Availability zones (3-6 generally)
-> AZ is one or more discrete data centers with redundant power, network and connectivity
-> They are seperated from each other so that they are isolated from disasters
-> They are connected with high bandwidth and ultra low latency network 

AWS POP (Points of presence)

-> Has more than 400+ edge locations 
-> Content is delivered to end users with lower latency 

Some of the global services of AWS are:

1) IAM
2) Route 53
3) Cloud Front
4) Web Access Firewall (WAF)
