IAM - Identity and access management

-> It is a global service
-> Root account is created default and should not be used or shared

Users and Groups

-> Users are people within our organization and can be grouped
-> Groups can contain only users and not other Groups
-> A user may not belong to any group and a user can belong to multiple groups 


Permissions:

-> Users and groups can be assigned JSON documents called policies
-> These policies define the permissions of the user 
-> IN AWS we apply leasr previliage rule - A user is not given more permissions than needed
