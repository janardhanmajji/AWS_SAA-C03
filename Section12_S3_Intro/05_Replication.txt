Replication - CRR and SRR

-> Must enable versioning in both buckets
-> CRR - Cross region Replication
-> SRR - Same region Replication
-> Buckets can be in different AWS accounts
-> Copying is asynchronous
-> Must give proper IAM permissions to S3

Note:

* After enabling replication only new objects are replicated.
* S3 batch replication: used for replicating existing objects and objects that failed replication
 --Delete options
 * Can replicate delete markers (optional)
 * deletions with version id are not replicated

 * No chaining. EX: B1 has replication into b2 and b2 has replication into b3 then b1 objects will not be replicated to b3...
