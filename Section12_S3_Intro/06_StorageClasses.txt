-> Can move between classes manually or using lifecycle configurations

Durability and availability:

Durability:

-> No of objects that can be lost by s3
-> High durability (99.9999.... (11 9's)) 
-> Same for all storage classes

availability:

-> How readily a service is available
-> Varies on storage classes
standard has 99.99% availability

*** S3 Standard - General purpose:

-> 99.99% availability
-> used for frequently accessed data
-> low latency and high throughput
Use cases: Data analytics, Gaming and content distribution.

** S3 Infrequent access:

-> Less frequently accessed but rapid access when needed
-> Lower than S3 Standard
-> S3 Standard IA - 99.9% available
Use cases: Disaster Recovery and backups

** one_zone_infrequent_access:

-> high durability
-> data lost when az is destroyed
-> 99.5% availability
Use cases: secondary backups or data we can re-create

----Glacier

-> Low cost for archieving
-> Pricing: Price for storage + price for retrieval 

glacier_instant_retrieval: 
* Millisecond retrieval
* Minimum storage duration - 90 days

glacier_flexible_retrieval:
* expedited (1-5 minutes)
* Standard (3-5 hours)
* Bulk (5-12 hours)

* Minimum storage duration - 90 days.

glacier_deep_archieve:
-> Long term storage
* Standard : 12 hours
* Bulk : 48 hours

* Minimum storage duration: 180 days..

Intelligent tiering:

-> Move objects between access tiers based on usage
-> No retrieval charges

-> frequent access tier: default and automatic
-> infrequent access tier:  object not accessed for 30 days and automatic
-> archieve instant access tier: objects not accessed for 90 days and automatic
-> archieve access tier: configurable from 90 days to 700+ days and optional
-> deep archieve access tier: configurable from 180 days to 700+ days and optional
