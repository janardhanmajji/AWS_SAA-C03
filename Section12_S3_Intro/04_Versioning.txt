Versioning in S3

-> We can version your files in S3
-> We can enable this in bucket level
-> We overwrite the files by using version 1,2,3 etc...

Why versioning? 
    * Easy rollback to previous version
    * Prevent unintended deletion of our data 

What happens if we upload any file before enabling versioning?
***The version of that particular file will be "null"


*** Disabling versioning will not delete our previous versions..


-> If we want to roll back to our previous version go to show versions and delete the particular version id

*********** Cool thing:

If we donot delete the version id instead we delete a particular object it doesnot delete permanantly but it creates a delete marker (with another version id) cool right. So we can get the object back by deleting the delete marker (WTF!!!)
