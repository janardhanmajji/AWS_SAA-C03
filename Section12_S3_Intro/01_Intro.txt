S3

-> Advertised as "infinitely scaling storage"
-> Many websites use S3 as backbone
-> Many AWS services integrate with S3

Use cases:
* Backup and storage
* Disaster Recovery
* Archieve files
* Hybrid cloud storage
* Host applications
* Big data analytics etc..

Ex: Nasdaq and Cisco

Buckets:

-> S3 stores files into Buckets
-> The files are called objects and they are stored in Buckets
-> Buckets must have a globally unique name
-> Buckets are defined at region-level
-> They look like a global service but they are confined to a region

Naming convention:

* No uppercase, No underscore
* 3-63 characters
* Must not be IP
* must start with lowercase or any number

Objects:

Objects(files) have a key
Key is the full path of the file

Key: Prefix + Object name

-> There is no concept of "directories" in S3
-> The keys are just a long name that contain slashes
-> Object values are the content of the body
    * Max upload size is 5TB (5000GB)
    * If content > 5GB then use multi part upload

-> Object can also have 
    *meta data (key-value pairs) 
    *version Id
    *tags - for lifecycle purposes etc...
