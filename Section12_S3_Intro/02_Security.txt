S3 Security

1) User Based:

    * IAM Policy: which API calss should be used by which user from IAM

2) Resource based:

    * Bucket policies: Bucket wide rules from S3 console - allows croos account
    * Object access control list: finer grain (can be disabled)
    * Bucket access control list: less common (can be disabled)


IAM principal can access S3 object if the user IAM permissions allow it or resource Policy allows it "AND" there is no "explixit DENY"

-> Encryption: encrypt objects in S3 using Encryption keys

**S3 Bucket Policy:

-> JSON Based Policy
    * Resources: Buckets and objects to which it is applied
    * Effect: Allow/Deny 
    * Actions: Set of API which allow or Deny
    * principal: account/user to which policy is applied

We use S3 bucket policy to:
    * Grant public access to the bucket
    * Force objects to be encrypted at the upload
    * Grant access to another account (Cross- account)


Ex: Public Access - Bucket Policy

A user wants to access an S3 bucket then we have to add a bucket policy such that it allows public access. then the user can access the objects in the bucket.

Cross-Acount access - Bucket policy

-> We can also block public access.
-> This can be set at account level
