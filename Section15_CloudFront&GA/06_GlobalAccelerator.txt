Global Accelerator:

-> We have deployed an application in a region but we have global users for it
-> They go over the internet to access but may have latency issues due to many hops
-> We wish to go as fast as possible to minimize latency 

UniCast IP vs AnyCast Ip:

UniCast Ip: one server holds one IP Address
AnyCast Ip: all servers hold the same ip and the client is redirected to the nearest one 

**AWS Global Accelerator uses the concept of AnyCast Ip to work

-> We have an application in a region and have client all over the world
-> When the client tries to connect to the application they connect to the Edge locations
-> The edge location connects directly to the application with the help of AWS private network which gives low latency
-> This uses AnyCast Ip which sends to the nearest edge location

*Work with ElaticIp, EC2, ALB, NLB etc..
*Consistent performance
*It also has health checks
*Great for disaster recovery
*DDOS protection
