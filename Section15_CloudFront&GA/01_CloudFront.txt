CloudFront

-> CloudFront is a content delivery network
-> It improves the read performance by caching the content at edge locations
-> Low latency and improves user experience
-> 410 POP(Point of presence) globally - edge locations
-> It has DDOS Protection, integration with Shield and Web application firewall

Origins of CloudFront:

1) S3:
    * For distributing files and caching then at the edge
    * We can use Origin access control (OAC) to make sure that only clounfront can access S3 
    * Cloudfront can also be used as ingress - to upload files to S3 

2) Custom Origin: (HTTP)
    * ALB
    * EC2 
    * S3 Website
    * Any HTTP Backend

At a high level:

-> Whenever a client sends a request to edge location if it has the particular content it sends the response
-> Else it sends the request to the origin and gets it and stores in the local cache.

S3 as an origin:

-> The S3 Bucket must have S3 Bucket policy + Origin access policy to send data to edge locations.


CloudFront:
    *Global Edge network
    *Files are cached for a TTL
    *Great for static content that must be available everywhere

S3 Cross Region Replication:
    *Must be setup for each Region you want replication to happen
    *Files are updated in near-real time
    *Read only
    *Great for dynamic content that must be available with low-latency in a few Regions
