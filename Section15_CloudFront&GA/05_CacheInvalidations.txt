Cache Invalidations:

-> Our cloudfront has an origin and our origin has a backend
-> If we update our backend, the cloudfront doesnot know about it 
-> We get the updated content only after TTL expired

-> But we want the new content to be served as soon as possible
-> So we can perform an entire or partial cache refresh (bypassing TTL) by performing cloudfront invalidation 
-> We can invalidate all files(*) or a special path(/images/*)

TTL - Time to live
