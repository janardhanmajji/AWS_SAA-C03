Access points:

Assume an S bucket has both finance data and sales data. And we have a set of users who want to access   
    *finance people - finance data --> /finance/
    *sales people - sales data --> /sales/
    *analytics people - both finance and sales data but only read

To manage this they have created access points.
Ex: finance access point is connected to finance data using policy which gives read/write access.


With proper IAM permissions we can access the access points and connect to a specific data.

*Access points simplify access to security management of S3 Buckets
*Each access point have 
    *its own DNS name (Internet origin or VPC origin)
    *access point policy

VPC origin

* we can define the access point to be accessible from within the VPC 
* create a VPC EndPoint to access the access point.
