S3 Object Lambda

-> We use this to change the object before being retrieved by the caller application


How it works?

-> The user calls the S3 Object Lambda access point
-> It invokes the Lambda function
-> The Lambda function access through S3 Access point which invokes S3 Bucket

Use cases:
* Redacting personally identifiable information
* Converting data formats like JSON to XML etc.,,
