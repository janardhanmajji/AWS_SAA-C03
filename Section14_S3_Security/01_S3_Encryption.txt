Object Encryption:

We can encrypt objects in S3 Buckets using one of the 4 methods:

1) SSE
    *SSE-S3
    *SSE-KMS
    *SSE-C 

2) CSE

*****************

SSE-S3 -> Server side Encryption

* Encryption using keys handled, managed and owned by AWS
* Object is encrypted server side
* Encryption type is AES-256
* Enabled by default for new Buckets and new objects

Usr uploads a file and that object is paired with S3 Own key and performs Encryption.

*********************

SSE-KMS -> Server side Encryption - Key management system

* Encryption using keys handled and managedusing AWS-KMS
* Advantages: User control over keys+ audit key using cloud trail
* Encrypted at server side

User uploads a file and that object is paired with KMS key and performs Encryption.
If we need to access the object we need the access to the object and the KMS key.

Limitations:
It has certain limits (5500,10000 requests/sec) based on the region
We can request a quota increase using Service Quota console

*************************

SSE - C 

* Fully managed by the customer outside AWS
* S3 donot store the Encryption key we provide
* HTTPS must be used

**************************

Client-side Encryption:

* Use Client libraries like amazon S3 Client-side Encryption library
* Client must encrypt the data themselves before sending to S3
* Client must decrypt the data themselves before retrieving from S3
* customer fully manages keys and Encryption cycle

Encryption in transit/in flight

-> ALso called SSL/TLS
-> S3 exposes 2 end points
    * HTTP Endpoint: non encrypted
    * HTTPS Endpoint: Encryption in flight 

-> HTTPS is recommended
-> SSE - C Https Is mandatory

** aws:secureTransport is attached to bucket policy to allow only HTTPS users

-> We can also change the default encryption method....
-> SSE-C can be done only through AWS-CLI
