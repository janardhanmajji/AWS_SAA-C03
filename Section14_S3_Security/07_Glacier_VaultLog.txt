S3 Glacier Vault Log

-> It is used to Adopt a WORM Model --> Write Once Read Many model 
-> Used when we want to store and never want to modify or delete it 
-> Create a vault lock policy and lock for future edits

** Helpful for compliance and data retention

S3 Object Lock 

-> For S3 Object lock versioning must be enabled
-> Adopt a WORM Model (Write once Read Many) model
-> Block an object version deletion for a specific amount of time
-> retention modes:
Compliance
    *Object versions cannot be deleted by any user including root user
    *Retention modes cannot be changed and retention period cannot be shortened

Governanace:
    *Most users cannot delete an object version or alter its lock settings
    *Some users have special permissions (through IAM)

Retention period: protect the object for a fixed time and it can be extended
Legal Hold: 
    *protect the object indefinitely independent from retention period 
    *used using IAM permission
