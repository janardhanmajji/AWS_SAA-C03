CORS

-> Cross-Origin Resource sharing
-> Origin = scheme(protocol) + host(domain) + port 

** It is a web browser based mechanism to allow requests to other origins while visisting the main origin.
Ex:
http://example.com/app1 & http://example.com/app2 are same origin 
http://example.com/app1 & http://other.example.com are different 

If we have different origins the request will not be fulfilled unless the other origin allows request using CORS headers

** IN AWS S3 if a client makes a cross-origin request on our S3 bucket we need to enable the correct CORS headers..
** We can allow specific origin or all origins..
